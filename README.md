### Instructions
1. Put your name and the names of your TableBuddies+™ above.
2. Copy your Aquarium program into this repository, add, commit and push.
   - This should include a driver file, `Tank` class, `Animal` class and two subclasses.
3. Once all your TableBuddies+™ have dones this, copy the subclasses from all your TableBuddies+™ into your program.
4. Work together to modify your programs so that all the subclasses work under the same `Animal` superclass.
5. In your drive file, add Animals using the `keyPressed` function. Map each Animal type to a number key, starting at 1. When the user presses a number key, add the animal of that type at the current mouse coordinates.
